This is the first opportunity I have had of writing to my boy since we left Mauritius, a fortnight ago. It has been very cold nearly all the timeâ€”cold at least to us, after the bright warm sun and soft wind of our early winter days in Mauritius. At first we were all glad to feel the fresh wintry air, but soon we began to wrap ourselves up and walk quickly about the deck, or keep down below in the fine saloon of the big French steamer after it became dark. It was a beautiful ship; large, and very clean and comfortable; and there were just enough passengers on board to be sociable without being overcrowded.
